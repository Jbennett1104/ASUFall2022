Vision Statement:
  This product will be a software-based record keeping system for maintenance work done on a fleet of vehicles. The target customers are those companies or individuals who manage any type of a fleet of vehicles ranging anywhere from a semi-truck company to a taxi company. This product will greatly simplify these types of companyâ€™s mandatory record keeping requirements and allow them to better manage the maintenance work done to their fleet.
